This amazing book written by [Peter Kogge](http://www3.nd.edu/~kogge/)
is out of print for a while now (althrough used copies can be found).
The book has two parts. First part about functional programming goes from basic
lambda calculus into fully working compiler and virtual machine for a Lisp-like
language - [SECD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine).  Second part talks about
logical programming, logic theory, Prolog, and
[Warren Abstract Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Abstract_Machine), virtual
machine for Prolog. The logical programming part is especially interesting, its
architecture is different to what we're used to. The book contains description
of some real world implementations of Lisp and Prolog, including those made in
hardware.

If you're interested in reading the book, try to find an used copy on Amazon.
Because they are quite expensive, I've put my notes
[on github](https://github.com/mhlopko/architecture_of_symbolic_computers_notes).
